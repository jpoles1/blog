#Jordan Poles' Blog
This repository contains the code for my blog! It is currently running on github pages using the Jekyll engine to convert my posts (written in markdown) into HTML.

###Installation
In order to test the blog on a local machine you'll need a couple of things:

- Ruby
  - sudo gem install jekyll
  - sudo gem install jekyll-paginate
  - sudo gem install jekyll-gist
  - sudo gem install redcarpet
  - sudo gem install pygments.rb
