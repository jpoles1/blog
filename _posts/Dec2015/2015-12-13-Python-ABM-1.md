In my [last post](/blog/2015/12/13/agent-based-modeling/) I provided a bit of an introduction to the concept of agent based models (ABMs), and how they might be implemented in solving questions about disease dynamics in a given population. Now I'm going to talk a bit more about my own work towards developing an ABM using Python. I will particularly capitalize on the use of OOP as a tool for Agent Based Modeling.

Now, I am well aware that there are numerous softwares which have already been developed specifically for the purpose of ABM, which I could use. That, however, is not the point of this work.
