Well, the boot-loop has finally stopped taking over my watch; at least somewhat. Now I've got the boot-loop some of the time, and an error which stays on screen for a bit. I had actually seen this error screen before, but it always disappeared before I got a good look at it.

_The error and code displayed on my watch. You can also see my new watch-skin, I think it looks real nice. Too bad I'll probably have to replace it with my watch._
