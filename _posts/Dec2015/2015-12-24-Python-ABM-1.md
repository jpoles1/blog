In my [last post](/blog/2015/12/13/agent-based-modeling/) I provided a bit of an introduction to the concept of agent based models (ABMs), and how they might be implemented in solving questions about disease dynamics in a given population. Now I'm going to talk a bit more about my own work towards developing an ABM using Python. I will particularly capitalize on the use of OOP as a tool for Agent Based Modeling. You can find my current code in [this github repository](https://github.com/jpoles1/disease).

Now, I am well aware that there are numerous softwares which have already been developed specifically for the purpose of ABM, which I could use. That, however, is not the point of this project. I want to get down to the core of designing one of these programs, both as an exercise in programming, and to expand the depth of my knowledge in this subject.

###Python for ABM

I've always loved programming in Python, as it is easy and speedy to go from an idea to a functional program. It is for this reason that I have chosen it for this project. That said, Python is an interpreted language, and as such will have a hard time reaching speeds that are anywhere comparable to those achieved by compiled languages like the C variants. I am currently working on improving my C skills and knowledge, so a next step in this project might be to attempt to convert my program to C++. I would love to work more in Haskell, however the language is poorly suited for this project - it follows a functional as opposed to OOP programming style, and is difficult to program quickly.

###First Steps

I did a lot of reading and research before getting started on this project. Though I had a conception of how to approach the problem of designing a simulation, I had little practical experience or insight. I began by implementing a standard SIR model in R quite a while back. I will work to recreate this model in order to provide a point of comparison for the dynamics of the ABM model which I am building.

In both my mathematical and ABM models, I utilize a SIRD (Susceptible; Infected; Recovered; Dead) compartmentalized type model, which is a simple representation of disease progression with discrete states. When approaching modeling mathematically, we utilize a set of equations to describe bulk population dynamics:

![Equation for # recovered individuals](/blog/public/img/2015-12-13-Python-ABM-1/deltaR.png "Resistant Equation")
![Equation for # dead individuals](/blog/public/img/2015-12-13-Python-ABM-1/deltaD.png "Dead Equation")

where β = contact + infection rate between individuals; γ = recovery rate; and μ = death rate.
